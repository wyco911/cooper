            <h1>The Master Plan</h1><br>
            <h2>General Description: <br> <p>Cooper Union issues permit for redevelopment on two sites: 41 Cooper square and 51 Astor place. The proposal is controversial due to extended commercial use and erasure of Taras Shevchenko place. The Astor Place community and members of The Community Board 2 criticise the plans on the basis of gentrification and changing the atmosphere of the east village. A resident is quoted in the NYT article below was quoted as saying that ''the low-rise 19th-century tenements will be replaced by high-rise Midtown offices.''</p></h2>
            <h2>References: <br> <p>1. “Cooper Union is proposing massive changes for Astor Place by reconstructing one building across from 32 Cooper, which will include retail use on the ground floor, constructing a new office/classroom building to the north, changing traffic patterns and pedestrian walkways”
