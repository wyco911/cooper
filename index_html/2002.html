            <h2><p>May: The Community’s thoughts were heard</p>General Description: <br><P>A Joint Task Force is created within the institution to resolve issues with the community after various members protest and sign petitions. The Community Board 2 supports Cooper Union’s Joint Task Force decision to prohibit retail use of 41 Cooper and enters discussions about the building’s potential non-profit use. They also seek to preserve the original Hewitt Building as part of any new structure. September 3rd, the revisited plan was approved by the City Planning Commission. The revisited proposal excluded erasure of T.Shevchenko place.</P>>/h2>
