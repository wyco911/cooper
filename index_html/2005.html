            <h1>The First Loan </h1><br>
            <h2>General Description:<br> <P>In 2006, Cooper Union borrows $175 million as part of a complex and risky plan promoted by then-President George Campbell to finance a new academic building. Sufficient funds aren’t raised to complete the project even after the large loan.  Cooper’s only meaningful asset - the land under the Chrysler Building is Mortgaged against the loan. The groundbreaking and construction begins. 
            </P>></h2>
            <h2>References: <p>1. “MetLife offered a 30-year, $175 million loan at 5.85%, to be secured by a mortgage on the Chrysler Building property. A prepayment-penalty clause would make refinancing the loan nearly impossible. Debt service would begin at about $10 million a year in interest-only payments (or about one-fifth of Cooper Union’s annual revenue), building to $15 million a year with amortization starting in 2018.”
