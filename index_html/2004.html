            <h1>Cooper Union Student Protests</h1><br>
            <h2>General Description: <br> There are two stakeholder communities that were impacted by the construction <br> 
                of 41 Cooper Square the neighbourhood of The East Village / Bowery and <br>
                Cooper Union as an institution. This research is interested in understanding <br>
                the reactions of these two communities to the project - initial pushback and <br>
                concerns over the changing character of the neighbourhood, increased budgetary <br>
                issues for Cooper Union, the relationship of the building with the St. George <br>
                Ukrainian Catholic Church, and the reaction of Cooperâ€™s students, faculty and <br>
                staff to name a few. This report will be a survey of the inclusion or <br>
                exclusion of these parties to committees that were involved with the <br>
                construction/development of the New Academic Building. We will try to answer <br>
                which communities   was the NAB targeted towards as a branding tool and which <br>
                communities were excluded from the decision process.<br><br></h2>
