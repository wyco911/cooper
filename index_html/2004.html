            <h1>Redevelopment considered “necessary” for a stable future of the Institution</h1><br>
            <h2>General Description:<br> <p>In presentations to the board in 2005 and 2006, President Campbell concluded that completing the new building and the related 51 Astor Place transaction were necessary to secure Cooper Union's financial future by arguing that the longer the project is delayed, the more expensive it will be to construct a new building. President Campbell’s employment contract created an apparent conflict of interest in connection with the 2006 loan plan. In March 2005, the contract was amended to entitle him to a $175,000 bonus if the New Academic Building was built, and another $175,000 for leasing out the property at 51 Astor Place. 
                By late 2005, Cooper Union had received less than $40 million in donations to the Building Fund, which was less than half of what had been deemed necessary to commence construction
                </p>></h2>
            <h2>References: <p>1. “President Campbell told the Board of Trustees that any substantial delay in beginning construction would lead to a sharp increase in costs. At that point, the Board of Trustees began exploring alternatives to raise the needed funds to start the building. ”
